## 🔒 Privacy & Security (Detailed)

ARC FLASH is built with a **privacy-first approach**, ensuring that file transfers are strictly controlled and visible only to intended devices.

### 🛡️ Private Connection Model

* Devices must **authenticate before any transfer**
* Only connected devices can communicate
* No open broadcasting of files on the network

---

### 🔐 Session-Based Authorization

* Each connection uses a **unique session ID**
* File transfer is allowed only after session validation
* Prevents unauthorized access from other devices on the same network

---

### 🚫 Network Isolation

Even if multiple users are on the same WiFi:

* ❌ Other devices cannot see your files
* ❌ No shared public file list
* ✅ Transfers are strictly **device-to-device**

---

### 🔑 Controlled Sharing

* Files are shared only when:

  * User selects device manually
  * Connection is confirmed
* No automatic or background sharing

---
